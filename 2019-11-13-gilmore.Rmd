- Psychology is harder than physics
- But why?
- What to do?

| Realm               | Domain               |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| $W$   | The world |
| $B$   | The body |
| $N$   | The nervous system |
| $M$   | The mind |

## Nested causality

---

- Mind ($M$) within nervous system ($N$)
- Nervous system ($N$) within body ($B$)
- Body ($B$) within world ($W$)

## Mutual coupling of dynamic states

---

$\dot{M} = f(M,N)$

$\dot{N} = f(N,B)$

$\dot{B} = f(B,N,W)$

$\dot{W} = f(W,B)$

## Measure...

---

- $W$, $B$, $N$ **directly**
- At varied spatial & temporal scales

## Tenets of PCT

- *Perception* is the source of controlled variables
- *Actions* control perception with respect to some referent signal
- Nested hierarchies of perceptual control systems

## Related approaches

- Reafference, Helmholtzian 'unconscious inference'
- Ecological Psychology (e.g., Gibson, Turvey)
- Forward models/predictive control (e.g., Shadmehr & Mussa-Ivaldi; Wolpert)

---

- Embodied cognition
- Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) (Van Gelder; Thelen & Smith; Beer; Warren)

## Challenges

- Beyond the periphery (perception and action)
- Do peripheral dynamics inform central ones?
- Beyond qualitative dynamics

---

- How to characterize & measure the relevant state spaces

---

| Realm | State spaces | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| $W$    | $\Phi$       | Physical environment |
|        | $\Psi$       | Psychological environment |
| $B$    | $J$          | Joint/body position |
|        | $P$          | Physiological state |
| $N$    | $n$, $s$     | Neuronal activity, synaptic connectome |
| $M$    |              |                                        |

---

- And the relations among them, e.g. $W \rightarrow B \rightarrow N \leftrightarrow M$
- With sufficient precision and specificity
- Across relevant spatial and temporal scales

3. If there is no discrepancy, return to step 1. Otherwise,
    a. measure the current steam pressure;

    c. calculate the necessary throttle valve adjustment.
4. Make the throttle valve adjustment.

---

- Reconciles ecological and computational approaches
- Hierarchical/nested control systems commonplace
- Plausible mechanism for development

---

- More transparent mapping onto physical substrates
- Scheme for visualizing sequential processes

# Getting there from here

---

- *Deep* and *complete* computational theories of tasks
- Amenable to control theory analyses
- Complexity before simplicity

## We don't have to share toothbrushes...

---

- But we can share our data, our code, our materials, and our procedures
- In **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eproducible ways (Wilkinson et al. 2016)

## Make knowable unknowns

---

- What behaviors are most commonly measured in child development research?

---

What is the developmental trajectory of sensitivity to motion?

```

## Imagine if...

---

All of the prior studies that used the X paradigm were openly shared in formats you could use to calculate *a priori* distributions for your variables of interest.

---

The display code used for a study you wanted to replicate was readily available so you could verify the parameters used and make decisions for your planned replication.
